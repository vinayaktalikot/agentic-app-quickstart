### Option 2: Local Development Container

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Steps:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and set up

### Option 3: Other IDEs

You are free to use PyCharm, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, etc. Flow is mostly similar to running VSCode locally.

## GPT API Keys

Configure the following environment variables in `.env`:

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT="api_url"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

üî¥ **IMPORTANT**: `.env` is already included in `.gitignore`, so it won't be pushed to your Github Repo. Don't remove it from there and don't store these credentials elsewhere, otherwise the will be publicly available!

uv add package-name
uv venv

# Run commands with uv run
uv run python examples/code/01...
```
