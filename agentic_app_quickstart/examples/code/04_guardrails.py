Guardrails Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to implement input guardrails to control what kinds of
requests an agent will process. Guardrails act as safety mechanisms or filters that
check user input before it reaches the main agent.

Key concepts:
- Input Guardrails: Functions that check user input and can block certain requests
- Tripwire: A mechanism that stops processing when certain conditions are met
- Pydantic Models: Used to structure the guardrail's decision output
- Context Wrapper: Provides access to the current conversation context
- Safety & Control: Ensures agents only handle appropriate requests

Use cases:
- Content filtering (block inappropriate content)
- Topic restriction (only allow specific subjects)
- Security checks (prevent malicious inputs)
- Business rules enforcement
- Quality control
