Function Calling Agent Example

This example demonstrates how agents can use custom functions (tools) to extend their capabilities.
The agent can access real-time information like the current date and time by calling Python functions.

Key concepts:
- Function Tools: Python functions that agents can call to perform specific tasks
- @function_tool decorator: Marks a function as available for the agent to use
- Tools parameter: List of functions provided to the agent during creation

Use cases:
- Accessing real-time data (weather, time, stock prices)
- Performing calculations
- Interacting with APIs or databases
- File operations
