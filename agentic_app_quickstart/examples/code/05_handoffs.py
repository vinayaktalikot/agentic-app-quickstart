Agent Handoffs Example

This example demonstrates how to implement agent handoffs, where one agent can transfer
a conversation to another specialized agent based on the user's needs. This creates
a multi-agent system where different agents handle different types of requests.

Key concepts:
- Agent Handoffs: Transferring conversation control from one agent to another
- Specialized Agents: Different agents with specific expertise areas
- Handoff Functions: Functions that determine when and how to transfer control
- Multi-agent Workflow: Coordinating multiple agents to handle complex scenarios

Use cases:
- Customer support (general ‚Üí technical ‚Üí billing agents)
- E-commerce (product info ‚Üí order management ‚Üí support agents)
- Educational platforms (general tutor ‚Üí subject specialist ‚Üí assessment agent)
- Healthcare (intake ‚Üí specialist ‚Üí follow-up agents)
