# System flow documentation: how the csv analysis system works

## System architecture overview

the csv analysis system uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents that handle different types of requests:

```
user input → coordinator agent → specialized agent → response
                ↓
        memory & context management
                ↓
        seamless agent handoffs & coordination
```

## Agent roles and responsibilities

### Coordinator agent
- main system coordinator and entry point
- **responsibilities**: 
  - understand user requests
  - route to appropriate specialized agents
  - maintain conversation flow
  - handle general questions
- **tools**: access to all function tools
- **handoffs**: can transfer to any specialized agent

### data loader agent
- **primary role**: handle file operations and data preparation
- **responsibilities**:
  - load csv files
  - validate data integrity
  - provide dataset information
  - handle file-related errors
- **tools**: file loading, column info, basic dataset operations
- **handoffs**: can transfer to analytics or communication agents

### analytics agent
- **primary role**: perform data analysis and calculations
- **responsibilities**:
  - statistical calculations
  - pattern detection
  - correlation analysis
  - outlier detection
  - grouped analysis
- **tools**: all analytical tools (averages, correlations, outliers, grouping)
- **handoffs**: can transfer to data loader or communication agents

### communication agent
- **primary role**: user guidance and explanation
- **responsibilities**:
  - explain results in user friendly language
  - suggest follow up questions
  - provide guidance and help
  - translate technical findings
- **tools**: question suggestions, guidance tools
- **handoffs**: can transfer to other agents for deeper analysis

## question flow analysis

### simple questions flow

#### example: "what columns are in the dataset?"

```
1. user input: "what columns are in the dataset?"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as a data exploration question
4. coordinator uses get_column_names() tool directly
5. response: "columns: date, product, price, quantity, customer_state"
6. no agent handoff needed (coordinator handles directly)
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → tool execution → response

#### example: "what is the average price?"

```
1. user input: "what is the average price?"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as an analytics question
4. coordinator uses calculate_column_average("price") tool
5. response: "average price: 354.49"
6. no agent handoff needed (coordinator handles directly)
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → tool execution → response

### medium complexity questions flow

#### example: "what is the average salary by department?"

```
1. user input: "what is the average salary by department?"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as a grouping/aggregation question
4. coordinator uses group_by_column("department", "salary", "mean") tool
5. response: detailed breakdown by department
6. coordinator may suggest follow-up questions
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → advanced tool execution → response + suggestions

#### example: "are there any missing values in the dataset?"

```
1. user input: "are there any missing values in the dataset?"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as a data quality question
4. coordinator uses get_column_info() for each column
5. coordinator analyzes missing value patterns
6. response: comprehensive missing value report
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → multiple tool calls → analysis → response

### complex questions flow

#### example: "what are the correlations between numeric columns?"

```
1. user input: "what are the correlations between numeric columns?"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as advanced statistical analysis
4. coordinator may hand off to analytics agent for specialized handling
5. analytics agent uses find_correlations() tool
6. analytics agent provides detailed correlation analysis
7. response: comprehensive correlation matrix with insights
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → analytics agent → specialized tool → enhanced response

#### example: "suggest some interesting questions i can ask about this data"

```
1. user input: "suggest some interesting questions i can ask about this data"
2. coordinator agent receives input
3. coordinator identifies this as guidance/communication question
4. coordinator may hand off to communication agent
5. communication agent analyzes loaded dataset
6. communication agent uses suggest_questions() tool
7. communication agent provides contextual, intelligent suggestions
```

**flow path**: user → coordinator → communication agent → analysis + suggestions → enhanced response

## memory and context management

### session based memory
- **persistence**: conversations are stored in sqlite database
- **context awareness**: agents remember previous questions and loaded datasets
- **follow-up support**: users can ask "what about the median?" after asking about averages

### context limitations
- **single dataset**: only one csv file can be loaded at a time
- **dataset switching**: users must explicitly load a new file to switch datasets
- **context preservation**: loaded dataset information persists across questions

## single-file limitation explanation

### why one file at a time?

the system is designed to work with one csv file at a time for several reasons:

1. **memory efficiency**: keeps system memory usage manageable
2. **context clarity**: prevents confusion about which dataset a question refers to
3. **tool simplicity**: function tools are designed for single dataset operations
4. **user experience**: clearer and more focused analysis

### what happens when you mix questions?

```
scenario: user asks about sales data, then asks about employee data

1. user: "what is the average price?" (sales data loaded)
   response: "average price: 354.49"

2. user: "what is the average salary?" (still sales data loaded)
   response: "error: column 'salary' not found in current dataset"
   
3. system suggests: "please load the employee_data.csv file first"
```

## improved agent handoff system

### seamless handoffs with automatic question forwarding

the system now implements intelligent agent handoffs that automatically forward user questions:

```
1. user: "i want to load employee_data"
   coordinator: "for this, ask the data loader agent"
   system: "handing over to DataLoaderAgent"
   dataloader: "the csv file 'employee_data.csv' has been successfully loaded..."

2. user: "what is the average salary?"
   dataloader: "for this type of request, you should ask the analytics agent"
   system: "handing over to AnalyticsAgent"
   analytics: "the average salary is $73,466.67..."

3. user: "suggest some questions i can ask"
   analytics: "for guidance and suggestions, ask the communication agent"
   system: "handing over to CommunicationAgent"
   communication: "here are some interesting questions you can ask..."
```

### key improvements in handoff system

1. **automatic question forwarding**: after a handoff, the user's question is automatically processed by the new agent
2. **clean handoff messages**: simple "handing over to [AgentName]" without verbose explanations
3. **seamless user experience**: users don't need to repeat their questions after handoffs
4. **intelligent routing**: agents automatically redirect specialized requests to appropriate agents
5. **natural conversation flow**: handoffs happen invisibly in the background

### handoff detection logic

the system detects handoff intent by parsing agent responses for keywords:

- **data loader keywords**: "data loader", "file", "load"
- **analytics keywords**: "analytics", "analysis", "calculation"
- **communication keywords**: "communication", "guidance", "help"
- **coordinator keywords**: "coordinator", "general"

### example handoff scenarios

#### file operation handoff
```
user: "load sample_sales.csv"
coordinator: "for this, ask the data loader agent"
handing over to DataLoaderAgent
dataloader: "the csv file 'sample_sales.csv' has been successfully loaded..."
```

#### analysis handoff
```
user: "what are the correlations between price and quantity?"
dataloader: "for this type of request, you should ask the analytics agent"
handing over to AnalyticsAgent
analytics: "the correlation between price and quantity is -0.23..."
```

#### guidance handoff
```
user: "what should i ask next about this data?"
analytics: "for guidance and suggestions, ask the communication agent"
handing over to CommunicationAgent
communication: "here are some interesting questions you can ask..."
```

## error handling and user guidance

### common error scenarios

#### missing dataset
```
user: "what is the average price?"
system: "error: no dataset loaded"
system: "please load a csv file first using: load <filename>"
```

#### column not found
```
user: "what is the average salary?"
system: "error: column 'salary' not found in current dataset"
system: "available columns: date, product, price, quantity, customer_state"
system: "please load the appropriate dataset or check column names"
```

#### data type mismatch
```
user: "what is the average of the product column?"
system: "error: column 'product' is not numeric"
system: "numeric columns available: price, quantity"
```

### system guidance patterns

1. **automatic suggestions**: system suggests relevant actions when errors occur
2. **context-aware help**: guidance based on current dataset and user history
3. **tool recommendations**: suggests appropriate tools for user requests
4. **dataset switching guidance**: helps users navigate between datasets

## performance and optimization

### tool execution efficiency
- **caching**: frequently requested calculations are optimized
- **data validation**: checks are performed before expensive operations
- **error prevention**: validates data types and column existence early

### memory management
- **dataset loading**: only one dataset in memory at a time
- **session cleanup**: old sessions are automatically managed
- **resource optimization**: efficient pandas operations for large datasets

## user experience best practices

### recommended workflow
1. **start with overview**: ask about columns and basic dataset info
2. **explore basic patterns**: use simple statistics and counting
3. **dive into details**: ask for correlations, outliers, and groupings
4. **get insights**: ask for suggestions and pattern recognition
5. **switch datasets**: load different files for comparative analysis

### conversation flow tips
- **build on answers**: use follow-up questions to dig deeper
- **be specific**: mention column names and values clearly
- **use memory**: reference previous questions and answers
- **ask for help**: use "suggest questions" when unsure what to ask next

## system limitations and future enhancements

### current limitations
1. **single dataset**: only one csv file loaded at a time
2. **file format**: currently supports csv files only
3. **data size**: optimized for datasets up to several thousand rows
4. **real-time updates**: no live data connection (static file analysis)

### potential enhancements
1. **multi-dataset support**: compare and join multiple files
2. **additional formats**: support for excel, json, and database connections
3. **data visualization**: generate charts and graphs
4. **export capabilities**: save analysis results and reports
5. **batch processing**: analyze multiple files in sequence
